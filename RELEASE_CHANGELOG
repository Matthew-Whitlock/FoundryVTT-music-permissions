Add better configurability to permissions system. Most actions now require a GM to be active.
You can now configure permissions in ways like:
 * Allowing a player to see the songs in a playlist, but not edit or play them.
 * Allowing a player to play a playlist, but not see the songs inside (or skip songs).
