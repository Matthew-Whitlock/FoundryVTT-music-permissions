# Music Permissions

Enables global and per-playlist permission configuration. 

Each playlist may have permissions configured the same as actors/journals:
 * none: These players will be unable to see the playlist 
 * limited: These players will be able to see the playlist, but not the songs within. They cannot play/stop/edit the playlist.
 * observer: These players will be able to see the playlist and the songs within. They cannot play/stop/edit the playlist.
 * owner: These players can play/stop/edit the playlist and create/edit new playlists and folders, based on the module settings.

Via module settings, you can configure a minium role to be able to:
 * Control playlists: Players of at least this role can control playback of playlists that they are owners of.
 * Edit playlists: Players of at least this role can modify the contents of playlists they own, configure them, and create new playlists/folders.
